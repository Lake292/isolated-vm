<!--
Please only submit complete issues and questions. YOU ARE A SOFTWARE ENGINEER! Ask yourself: "if
someone was reporting an issue about something that I wrote what information would be helpful?".
That is, please include your nodejs version, your operating system version, your compiler version,
what you've tried so far to fix the issue (especially this one!).. things like that.

If some specific code is triggering the issue then please include a FULL EXAMPLE of the code that
can be run on its own. Please no "snippets", if I can't run the code without modifications then I
can't help you.
